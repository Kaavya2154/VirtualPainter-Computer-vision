# 🎨 Virtual Painter

Draw in the air using your hand — no mouse, no pen, just pure AI magic 🪄  
This project uses **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** to detect your hand and let you draw virtually on your webcam feed!

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. The webcam captures your hand in real time  
2. MediaPipe tracks your hand landmarks  
3. Your **index finger** acts as the brush tip  
4. You can select colors, erase, clear the screen, and even save your artwork!
